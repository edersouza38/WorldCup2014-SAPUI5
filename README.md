WorldCup2014-SAPUI5
===================

World Cup 2014 SAPUI5 App

This is an Web App created using SAPUI5, SAP's UI Framework to leverage creation of HTML5 components.
It uses 4 JSON Models:

  * team.json;
  * venue.json;
  * match.json;
  * group.json;
  
The idea is to show how multiple JSON models can be connected in SAPUI5.
